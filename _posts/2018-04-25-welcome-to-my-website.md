This website ([https://lorddarkula.github.io](https://lorddarkula.github.io)) will serve as my personal website.
In the coming weeks I will update the About Me page and add descriptions
of current and past projects. I hope to write the occasional blog post, but we will see
if that ends up actually happening. Feel free to check out the Talks page, as it is already completed.
I should get back to working on the website now.
