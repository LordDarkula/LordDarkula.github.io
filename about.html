## About

I am a speaker, programmer, and student. I am currently an undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology where I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

I spend most of my free time programming side projects (such as this one), and it has led to me speaking at multiple conferences, and an internship with the United Nations. 

The programming languages I am most comfortable with are Python, Java, Swift, and Scala, but I am a fast learner and have dabbled with Mathematica and Go as well.

I participate in hackathons as well, and have worked on projects that ranged from Virtual Reality to Machine Learning.
