You have reached the personal website of Aubhro Sengupta (LordDarkula on GitHub and Twitter). 

I am a speaker, programmer, and student. I am currently an undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology where I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

I spend most of my free time programming side projects (such as this one), and it has led to me speaking at multiple conferences,
and an internship with the United Nations. 

The programming languages I am most comfortable with are Python, Java, Swift, and Scala, but I am a fast learner and
have dabbled with Mathematica and Go as well.  

I participate in hackathons as well, and have worked on projects that ranged from Virtual Reality to Machine Learning. 

I have a rare physical condition called [Kniest Dysplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kniest_dysplasia). This condition causes me to have hearing loss, vision loss, mobility issues, and a short stature. If you have never heard of the condition, then I would not be surprised as the article on wikipedia is shorter than I am. But all of those issues do not bother me, as all my friends also happen to be devout nerds who do nothing but study and code. 

I also occasionally play chess, play guitar, and swim (Its one of the few physical activities I can do).
